        <h1>How AI Is Reshaping Modern Credit-Card Platforms</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many issuers now market “AI credit cards”, but the core changes sit inside their decision engines: machine-learning risk models, automated controls and data-heavy analytics. This page explains what actually changes for cardholders.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Do Issuers Mean by an “AI Credit Card”?</h2>
      <p>When issuers talk about AI credit cards, they usually mean that risk decisions, fraud checks or customer insights are powered by machine-learning models rather than only static rules. The plastic in your wallet does not change; the logic behind approvals and alerts does.</p>
      <p>These models learn from large amounts of transaction and behavioural data. The goal is to approve more legitimate activity, stop more fraud and automate routine decisions with less manual intervention.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Where AI Lives in the Card Stack</h2>
      <p>AI components typically sit in the issuer’s backend, not on the card itself. They plug into authorisation systems, case-management tools and mobile apps that expose features like alerts, spending breakdowns and dynamic controls.</p>
      <p>Some fintechs also expose AI capabilities directly to end users in the form of spending summaries, predictive cash-flow views or automated budgeting suggestions.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- AI Features -->
    <section id="features" class="section">
      <h2>Examples of AI-Powered Features in Credit Cards</h2>
      <p>Not every provider offers the same set of capabilities, but these are typical areas where AI now plays a role:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Adaptive fraud scoring:</strong> Models weigh device, location, merchant type and history to decide if a transaction should be approved, declined or challenged.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time spend categorisation:</strong> Algorithms automatically classify purchases, enabling detailed dashboards without manual tagging.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart notifications:</strong> Systems highlight unusual patterns, subscriptions that renew soon or charges that differ from past behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic credit policy:</strong> Risk engines may adjust internal appetite for certain merchants, countries or transaction types as data evolves.</li>
        <li><strong>Offer and rewards targeting:</strong> AI matches customers with campaigns, bonus categories or merchant offers likely to be used.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks & Design -->
    <section id="risks" class="section">
      <h2>Design Questions and Risks to Consider</h2>
      <p>AI features do not automatically make a card better. The way they are designed and governed matters.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Data usage and privacy:</strong> Check how long spending data is stored, who it is shared with and how it is anonymised, if at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Model transparency:</strong> Some issuers explain what their systems optimise for; others treat it as a black box. This affects how predictable decisions feel to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Error handling:</strong> False declines and incorrect categorisation can be frustrating. Good implementations make it easy to correct or override outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Human oversight:</strong> AI models need monitoring and review, especially where approvals or blocks have real-world impact for customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory constraints:</strong> In some markets, regulators expect explainability for automated decisions, influencing how aggressively AI can be used.</li>
      </ul>
